Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Time Series Data (25 Points)
Objective: Perform EDA on the air quality data streamed from Kafka, focusing on understanding the temporal patterns in pollutant concentrations and relationships between different pollutants.

Time Series Analysis Requirements:

Analyze time-based patterns in the data
Explore relationships between different pollutants
Identify seasonality, trends, and anomalies
Deliverables:

Basic Visualizations (15 Points):
Time-series plots of CO, NOx, and Benzene concentrations
Daily/weekly patterns (average by hour of day, day of week)
Correlation heatmap between different pollutants
Advanced Visualizations (Optional - 5 Bonus Points):
Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots
Decomposition of time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals
Analysis Report:
2-3 page report describing patterns you observed
Analysis of potential factors influencing air quality variations
Discussion of how your findings will inform your modeling approach
